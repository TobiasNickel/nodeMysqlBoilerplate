#Boilerplate for fast project starts

The webserver can be used for Web and by mobile apps. The whole framework structure is already demonstrated by handling authentication. A simple login and registration. 

## webserver
The webserver is build in many layers, each has a folder under web-server. In addition there is a utils folder, for modules that might be used by multiple layers.

 - routes: taking parameter from requests using methods on the services and rendereing views. Here the parameter should be validated for security, and taken from the request. Each request should only use one method on a service.
 - service: containing the applicationLogic. Services also start and finish transactions. They use the DAOs to communicate with datasources. 
 - dao: A DAO is an Object to access the database. usually one dao per mysql-table. In this app, for mysql they get generated by tmysqlpromisedao. but they could get written so allow access to other databases such as couch or redis. They should unified interface so that when developing services, you know what to expect.
 - views: Currently configured to render JADE templates. A convinient way to generate HTML pages.

In the Koa2 branch I want to try typescript using ts-node. The reason for that is use async await. I 
also want to see how the debugging behaves. on top of that I need replacements for all the middleware.
session, csrf protection, views;
